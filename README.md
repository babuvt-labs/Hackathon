**Recommendations:**
https://dev.azure.com/devops-hackathon/Kynlabs/_apis/build/status%2FDevsecops-Pipeline?branchName=main
<ul>
    <li>Use <em>python:3.8-slim-buster</em> for a balance of security and size.</li>
    <li>If size is critical, try <em>python:3.8.2-alpine3.18</em>.</li>
    <li>For production environments, consider <em>distroless/python3</em>.</li>
</ul>

**Distroless Base Image**

**Googleâ€™s distroless Python image for enhanced security:**

FROM gcr.io/distroless/python3

    Why? Stripped down to only the essentials, reducing vulnerabilities.
    Pros: Highly secure and production-ready.
    Cons: Limited debugging tools and slightly larger than Alpine images (~25MB).


**Summary of Docker Image Storage Options:**   
    <p>**Public Registries (e.g., Docker Hub, Quay.io, GitHub Container Registry)**
        <br>Open, free, and public sharing of images.
    <p>**Private Registries (e.g., ACR, ECR, Google Container Registry, Harbor)**
        <br>Secure, private image storage for teams or enterprises.    
    <p>**Self-hosted Registries (e.g., Docker Registry, Nexus Repository)**
        <br>Full control over image storage in your own infrastructure.        
    <p>**Object Storage (e.g., S3, GCS)**
        <br>Store images manually in cloud object storage as tarballs.


Each of these options has specific advantages depending on your use case, such as ease of use, integration with cloud services, and security requirements.
